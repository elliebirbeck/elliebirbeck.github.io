				<p><b>PROJECT /</b> San Francisco Crime Classification / Mar 16</p>
				<p>I took part in a machine learning competition on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, an organisation which hosts data science competitions sponsered by large companies or leading researchers, in order to solve real-world problems.
				<p>Given several hundred thousand pieces of data relating to crimes that had occured across the city of San Francisco, the aim of the competition was to accurately classify new data instances by the type of crime, such as arson or theft. To develop a classifier I experimented with different feature sets, and a range of machine learning algorithms including Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbour, and Random Forests. 
				<p>I extended the given feature set by creating additional spatial metrics such as distances to the city centre and police department districts, grid cell locations, and testing variations in format and type of temporal measurements. Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and performing ablative analysis to understand the contributions of individual features allowed me to refine the final feature set and build the model. Tools used for this project were Weka, Java, and R.
				<p>The competition was judged based on the resulting multi-class logarithmic loss of the classification. My classifier improved on a baseline logloss value of 3.65, reducing it by 28% to 2.61. The winning competition entry achieved 2.05. A <a href="../files/sanfran-paper.pdf">report</a> on this project details the implementation and evaluation of results.
